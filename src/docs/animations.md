title: Animations

If your 3D model contains embedded animation clips, you can play, trim, and configure them before exporting.

## Loading Animations

Animations are loaded automatically when you import a model that contains them. Supported formats with animation:

- `.glb` / `.gltf` — Full animation support.
- `.fbx` — Animation support (quality depends on the exporter).
- `.obj` — No animation support.

## Per-Clip Settings

Select an animation clip to configure it:

| Setting          | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Speed            | Multiplier on playback speed (0.5 = half, 2.0 = double) |
| Loop Mode        | Loop Once, Loop Repeat, or Ping Pong                    |
| Trim Start / End | Cut frames from the beginning or end of the clip        |
| Duration         | Total duration of the clip in seconds                   |

## Hiding Animation Clips

If a model imports with extra clips, duplicates, or test takes, use **Hide selected animation** instead of deleting the data. Hidden animations are filtered out of animation dropdowns and workflow generation, which keeps capture lists easier to read.

Hidden clips are reversible:

- **Hide selected animation** hides the active clip for the current model.
- **Restore hidden animations** makes every hidden clip for that model visible again.

If the currently selected animation is hidden, the model switches to no active animation so playback and workflows do not accidentally use the hidden clip.

## Creating Animations from Camera or Photo

You can generate animation clips directly from your webcam, a video, or a photo using **Pose Studio**. Open it from the top **Pose** menu or click **Create Pose / Motion Clip** in the Animation panel. After capture, the edit step lets you trim frames, fix tilt or facing direction, mirror poses, select bones in the preview, rotate them directly, and fine-tune values before saving.

See [Camera Animation Capture](camera-capture) for the full workflow.

## Exporting Animations

When you export, all frames from the selected animation are captured in sequence. The export panel shows the total frame count based on your FPS setting and animation duration.

For multi-animation exports (e.g. idle + walk + run in one sprite sheet), use **Workflows** to automatically batch all clips across multiple camera angles. See the [Workflows](workflows) doc.

## Tips

- Keep animation clips short and named clearly in your 3D tool — names carry through to the exported metadata.
- Use **Ping Pong** loop mode for symmetrical animations (breathing, hovering) to halve the frame count.
- **Trim** the first and last frame if your 3D tool adds a hold frame at the loop boundaries.
