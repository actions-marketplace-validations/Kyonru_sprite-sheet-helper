---

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Workflow animation sections with group toggles, collapse/expand controls, selected-section editing, and disabled animations collapsed by default.
- Per-animation workflow capture timing overrides for frame interval and captured frame count.
- Workflow force-in-place axis modes, including all axes, horizontal XZ, individual X/Y/Z axes, and none.
- Reset Camera actions in the workflow camera draft and top camera panel context menu.
- Animation renaming from the animation inspector.
- Structured workflow direction metadata in exported spritesheet JSON and manifest files, including `directionalAnimations` groups.

### Improved

- Workflow animation settings are more compact and keep capture timing controls with animation-specific settings.
- Manual animation recording names new sequence rows from the active animation instead of a generic `animation_#` label.
- Orthographic workflow camera controls now treat distance as zoom in the UI, preview, and capture path.
- Workflow preview and capture now preserve orthographic zoom and rotation consistently.
- Hidden animations are skipped by default when generating workflow rows.

### Fixed

- Imported/copied animations now persist when saving/reloading projects and when exporting models.
- Workflow capture now respects configured animation start/duration trimming instead of resetting clips to the full range.
- Multiple workflow rows with the same animation name remain distinguishable in exports through model-aware direction grouping.

## [0.6.0]

### Added

- Perspective/Orthographic main camera mode across editor, workflows, preview, and export.
- Reversible animation hide/filter controls, including workflow filtering for disabled clips.
- First-party inspector controls replacing Leva in main editor inspectors.
- Export-time Spritesheet Postprocess with Outer Outline, Drop Shadow, Glow, Color Adjust, crisp-pixel outlines, animated preview, and normal-map-safe padding.
- New outline options: EdgeOutline, Silhouette Outline, and renamed Selection Outline.
- Model Fit to Camera action.

### Improved

- Workflow UI layout, preview resizing, animation settings, and force-in-place controls.
- Inspector styling, numeric input editing, range sliders, and compact export/postprocess panels.
- Materials Workbench sizing with a Pose Studio-like workspace.
- Collapsible Spritesheet Postprocess and Recent Exports sections.

### Fixed

- Camera type switching bugs, including orthographic property updates and workflow preview/export consistency.
- Workflow preview resizing, disabled-animation row generation, and record-button state during active captures.
- Leva update-depth crashes and hidden-animation history watcher crashes.
- Effect preset crashes after deleting effects and preview freezes from Depth Debug.
- Spritesheet postprocess preview, zoom, before/after alignment, atlas metadata, normal padding, and project persistence.

### Removed

- Depth Debug preset/effect path.
- Leva usage from migrated main editor inspector surfaces.

### Documentation

- Updated camera, workflows, animations, effects, exporting, normal maps, projects, troubleshooting, tutorial, README, and CLI docs.
- Added Materials Workbench docs and navigation.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- Add model visibility
- Import animations into selected model
- Add in place option
- add more Workflow config
- Crash recovery with auto-saved project state and a restore/debug/reset dialog
- Animation freeze options for imported clips
- Warnings when browser storage is almost full or a save exceeds the quota
- MIT license and contributing guide

- Test coverage ~65% → ~74% (history, scene stores, exporters, OPFS helpers)
- Docs: storage limits and recovery troubleshooting

### Fixed

- Prevented model import crashes when loading or importing after sequence recording by strengthening model load-state handling and runtime cleanup.
- Added model render/load error boundaries with toast notifications so failed FBX/GLB loads no longer break the scene.
- Updated model import and material workflows to only expose actions/tools for fully loaded models.
- Added rollback on import failure and expanded model removal cleanup to clear related animation/mixer state.
- Added a regression E2E test covering FBX import after sequence capture without losing captured sequence rows.

## [0.4.1]

### Added

- Railway/Railpack production deployment config for hosting the web app

- Docker release workflow uses Node 24-ready Docker actions
- Docker Action now points at the newest published GHCR image
- CI example project uses `Kyonru/sprite-sheet-helper/action@main` and is validated during release smoke tests

### Fixed

- Fixed Railway build detection by forcing Railpack's Node provider instead of Python detection from docs dependencies
- Fixed release failures caused by trying to create floating GitHub Action tags blocked by repository rules

## [0.4.0]

### Added

## [0.3.1]

### Added

- Add option to include smear postprocessing with 2 type of implementations
- Improve tutorial and documentation
- remove camera option from tauri builds

## [0.3.0]

### Headline: Camera Animation Capture

Record animation clips from your webcam or a photo directly in the app — no 3D animation software needed. All pose detection runs in the browser via MediaPipe; nothing is uploaded.

### Added

#### Camera Animation Capture

- **Live webcam recording** — pose detection at up to 30 FPS with real-time 3D model preview and skeleton overlay
- **Photo upload mode** — capture a single static pose from any image file
- **Root motion** — optional hip height tracking for jumps, crouches, and vertical movement
- **Bone remapping panel** — map captured bones to any rig naming convention; auto-detect by pattern

#### Pose Review Step

- **Timeline scrubber** — step through every captured frame before saving; model updates live
- **Trim & delete** — trim from start, trim from end, or delete individual frames
- **Global Corrections panel** (non-destructive until save):
  - X / Y / Z rotation sliders to fix tilt, turn direction, and lateral lean
  - Mirror L↔R — swap left and right limbs and reflect their rotations
  - Flip 180° shortcut for clips captured from behind
- **Bone Adjustments panel** — per-bone X / Y / Z euler sliders per frame; "Apply to all frames" to propagate a correction across the whole clip
- Corrections are baked into frame data only on save; preview always reflects the corrected pose

#### CLI & Workflows

- **CLI mode** — headless batch processing via `npm run cli` or after global install: `sprite-sheet-helper <input> [options]`
- **Workflow presets** — automated multi-angle, multi-animation capture in a single command:
  - `topdown-8dir` — 8-directional top-down (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)
  - `topdown-4dir` — 4-directional top-down (N, E, S, W)
  - `isometric` — isometric 45° (SE, NE, NW, SW)
  - `platformer` — side-view (Right, Left)
- CLI options: `--format`, `--frames`, `--fps`, `--width`, `--height`, `--output`, `--port`, `--workflow`, `--cameraDistance`
- CI/CD integration support

#### Export Formats

- Added engine-native exporters: **Bevy**, **Godot**, **Unity**, **Phaser 3**, **pygame**, **raylib**, **LÖVE 2D** (lua + anim8), **Turbo**
- Format aliases: `bevy-rust` → `bevy`, `love2d` → `love2d-lua`

#### Documentation

- In-app documentation modal with full-text search (Fuse.js)
- New page: **Camera Animation Capture** — full workflow guide
- Updated **Animations** page with camera capture cross-reference
- Per-doc icons in sidebar, logical page ordering, and working in-doc navigation links

### Changed

- **About modal** — redesigned with gradient hero banner, creator profile links, and sponsor button
- **Docs modal** — improved sidebar (active left-border indicator, per-doc icons, page count), compact search bar with clear button, document title header above prose content
- Docs sidebar order now follows logical reading order (Getting Started → Tutorial → … → CLI)

### Fixed

- Forward tilt in captured poses caused by Z-axis depth from MediaPipe world landmarks — landmarks are now projected onto the XY plane for frontal captures
